        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Dr. Panzarella, a longtime professor of Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, died peacefully on August 2nd after a long illness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After a childhood in Rhode Island with his ten siblings, Dr. Panzarella became a Christian Brother, taking the name Brother Andrew and engrossing himself in eschatological studies (studies of heaven, hell, and judgment). He authored Growth in Christ, a book used in catechetical adult education throughout The United States especially in Catholic high schools and confirmation of Christian doctrine classes (CCD); as well as Religion and Human Experience, a book assessing inherent religious values in countries like China and Indonesia. He is still known to his immediate family as Andrew.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dr. Panzarella received his Bachelor’s  and Master’s Degree from The Catholic University of America.  After several years in the 1960s as a high school teacher and counselor in private high schools in NYC. Dr. Panzarella completed an additional Master’s Degree at the City College of New York and received his PhD from the City University of New York, beginning his long association with John Jay College of Criminal Justice that continued until his retirement in 2017 as a full professor in the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration. During that time much of his teaching and research focused on the psychological foundations of police work, computer applications in the criminal justice field and introducing students to major historical works in criminal justice.  He was known among colleagues for unorthodox and bold thinking in his areas of expertise. Although he had a very active research life, he was also deeply engaged in the practical applications of his broad knowledge – producing many training materials and videos; and conducting, overseeing, and assessing the training of police, probation, security, firefighting, and other city personnel, not only in New York but also overseas including at the Police Academy of Puerto Rico and The Police Staff College in Bramshill, United Kingdom. A member of innumerable College Committees, Dr. Panzarella was highly respected not only for his knowledge, organization, creativity and hard work, but also for the unruffled demeanor that he brought to his involvements. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Widely traveled, Dr.  Panzarella traveled to more than 100 countries from which he delighted to bring back cultural artifacts. A proud Brooklynite, he delighted in the culture and food of his adopted home and loved sharing it with all. He was amply appreciated by friends and colleagues for his stories of adventure, shrewd and generous financial advice, and gourmet recommendations. He will be missed by many chefs and waiters who knew him from his distinguished taste and consistent patronage over many decades.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He is pre-deceased by his mother and father, Blanche and Liborio (Billy) Panzarella and three brothers James, Michael, and Joseph.  Surviving him are a brother, Pat (Jan); six sisters, Mariann, JoAnn (Ed), Angela, Meg (Bill), Elizabeth, and Cheryl (Jonathan); and a great many nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews to all of whom he was very attentive and generous.  He is also survived by his dear friend of many years, Tom, and many friends and colleagues who he met in his beloved New York City including a goddaughter, Lori.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
             A funeral mass will be celebrated at Saint Augustine Roman Catholic Church on 116 6th Ave in Brooklyn on August 13th at 10:30 and a memorial service to celebrate his life will be held on Augustine 31st in Rhode Island.</p>
